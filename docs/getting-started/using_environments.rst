==================
Using Environments
==================

Our package provides tools for generating kinds of environments and
representations, which we will discuss in detail. Here we preview how one could
go about designing interactions with an environment once constructed. The below
(:download:`scripts/visualize_random_bot_in_terminal.py
<../../scripts/visualize_random_bot_in_terminal.py>`) is an example that prints
the interactions of an agent in an environment created from `YAML` to the
terminal.
